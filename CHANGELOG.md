# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0).

Note: this changelog starts from 3.0.0, as it is built from scratch and therefore the code has no meaningful shared history with the 2.0.0 version. The 2.0.0 version of this tool lives in [w3c/wcag-em-report-tool](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool/) and has its own changelog there.

### Added

* Rebuild of the 2.0.0 version of the WCAG-EM Report Tool in Svelte
