## About this tool

The WCAG-EM Report tool is an assistant that takes the user through the process of evaluating the accessibility of a website, using the [WCAG Evaluation Methodology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

It is developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Initially developed with support from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ACT/">WAI-ACT Project</a>, and updated with support of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Tools/">WAI-Tools Project</a>, co-funded by the European Commission (EC).
